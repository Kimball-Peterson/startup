**Git Notes**\
***- Git is useful. Use it.***\

**EC2**\
*** ●	EC2 instance is remote access to running machine in different location (N. Virginia in my case)\
	●	EC2 instance can be accessed from my command line.\
	●	Elastic IP allows me to stop the instance if I want to without having a new public IP assigned.\
	●	Server size t3.nano should be adequate (I am using t2)\
