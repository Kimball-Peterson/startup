Startup application for CS260

## Elevator Pitch
I will create a sales/social/research platform for cars/trucks/rare items (art collectibles)/anything I find cool or of value. Could be very versatile as knowing the measure of "cool" something is can be useful. Anything with a presence could be taken into account. Rare, high-hp/racecar/purpose-built, new, sought-after, really anything desirable. Pull data from social media including keywords provided by user when they make a listing, videos, photos, race results provided by user. Compiles info about item to be sold/displayed/researched like notoriety from social media, the internet, auctions, news sites. Platform could be scaled to other items, think of it as giving the kind of info that people tend to wish they could know about high value, or notable objects before they buy, like whether people like, respect, wish to know more about them ( think art,cars, collectibles, furniture). 

## Key Features
App will include the following:
- Sales/Classifieds Platform (initial thought was geared towards high power, specifically built cars (hard to sell in open market due to specific buyers)
- Social platform to gauge influence of specific items, glean data and use to sell more efficiently or as metrics for influence. Data could be valuable to many.
- Likes and comments as units. Real time comments shared across users views of page.
- Messaging Platform(far out) to allow sale of vehicle through the app.
- Maybe storefront for applicable goods.
  
## Technologies
**Authentication**: Users will need an account to interact with listed items or to post items. Like, comment on, view more than a certain number and will be prompted to create an account to continue.
**Database data**: Store data about interaction, prices, interaction effect on interest in items.
**WebSocket data**: Comments and likes will be realtime data passed between each users view of the pages. A message platform might be a far out dream but would create a full service sales platform. A tally of sales and influence of platforms features on sale kept to market platform.
